# Tower of Hanoi Visualizer
## ðŸ“Œ Overview

A command-line visualizer that recursively solves the Tower of Hanoi problem.
Developed as a Data Structures project using recursion.
Displays the movement of disks across rods using an ASCII-based visual output after each step.

---
## ðŸ›  Features
---
- Solve Tower of Hanoi using recursion
- Visualize each move with ASCII rods and disks
- Show step-by-step or automatic execution
- Count total moves and compare with optimal moves

---

## ðŸ“‚ Data Structures Used
- Recursion â†’ For solving the puzzle
- List (stack-like operations) â†’ To represent rods and disk movements
